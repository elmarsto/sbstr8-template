# What is sbstr8? (Prounounced â€˜substrateâ€™)

 - A maximalist, ultra-modern, opinionated blog starter for rich, interactive storytelling by creatives who code in Typescript React.

## Why another starter?

Because â€˜small and simpleâ€™ usually means â€˜limitedâ€™. Your posts could be more than just plain text; they could be *experiences*. Go ahead, flex your creative (o)pinions. ðŸª½

If you really want a minimalist no-JS blogging engine, you could do much worse than [Soupault](https://soupault.app), and if you *really, really* hate complexity, there is the elegant, spare [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space). For good and for ill, thatâ€™s not what Substrate is about.

But what if you want to do media-rich storytelling, but coding in Typescript and React isnâ€™t your jam? In this case, please do check out the professional choice for interactive storytelling, the superlative [Vev](https://vev.design). Yet itâ€™s not open source, and is not optimal for hosting e.g. arbitrary chunks of React. Vev low-code/no-code, which is great for professional journalists, but less great for those of us who donâ€™t feel weâ€™ve done any real work until thereâ€™s a `.tsx`.

By contrast, Substrate is code-first and [clastic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clastic). With Substrate, and a basic knowledge of Typescript and React, your only limit is the imagination. And while we rely on [Nextâ€™s tree shaking](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10-2) to keep bundle size down, we prioritize immersiveness and creative freedom over counting kilobytes. The bundle size will be what the bundle size needs to be. **Because Substrate is for creatives who code.**

## Caveats

  - **Currently in alpha!** Caveat Forker.
  - Mostly Iâ€™m just assembling my favourite libraries into a coherent whole; I stand upon the shoulders of veritable giants. I try to get out of the way as much as possible. E.g. you talk directly to Headless UI, Framer Motion, Babylon, etc. This also means that I hereby punt on most documentation issues; if you have a question about how to use one of the provided libraries, see the documentation for that library.

## Land acknowledgment

 - Substrate was put together in part on the unceded and ancestral territory of the hÉ™nÌ“qÌ“É™minÌ“É™mÌ“ and Sá¸µwxÌ±wÃº7mesh speaking peoples, the xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m (Musqueam), Sá¸µwxÌ±wÃº7mesh (Squamish), and sÉ™lilwÉ™taÉ¬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. I, Elizabeth Marston, am an uninvited guest here, and Iâ€™m looking for ways to give back. If you have thoughts on how this project could help the indigenous Coast Salish peoples decolonize, let me know!

## Why is the license GPL, and not MIT?

 - Because the now-routine scraping of GitHub by its owner to train AIâ€Œs that regurgitate FOSSâ€Œ code verbatim is a form of license-washing. MITâ€Œ License provides no cover or resistance to this, and therefore, in 2023, is obsolete.
 - Because the GPL still allows you to customize and build your own unique product with this tool, and host it. However, it motivates contributors *to the codebase* to do so in the open.
